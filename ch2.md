#Chapter 2 Notes
##add command
git add is a multipurpose command. You use it **to begin
tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge conflicted files as resolved**. It may be helpful to think of it more as “add this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”.

##git status short
**git status -s**

New files that aren’t tracked have a ?? next to them, new files that have
been added to the staging area have an A , modified files have an M and so on.
There are two columns to the output - the left hand column indicates that the
file is staged and the right hand column indicates that it’s modified.

For an example, check page 49.
